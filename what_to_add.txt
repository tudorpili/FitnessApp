I. Enhanced Tracking & Logging:

Sleep Tracking: Log bedtime, wake-up time, maybe a quality rating (1-5 stars), and notes. Visualize sleep duration/consistency.
Water Intake Tracking: Simple interface to log glasses/bottles/liters of water consumed daily. Visualize progress towards a daily goal.
Body Measurements: Track more than weight â€“ waist, hips, chest, arms, thighs, body fat % (if user knows it). Visualize changes over time.
Progress Photos: A section to upload photos tagged with a date to visually track body composition changes (requires storage).
Mood/Energy/Stress Logging: Simple daily check-in (e.g., sliders or emoji selection) to see correlations with activity, sleep, or nutrition.
Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) / Intensity Logging: Add an optional field to workouts or sets to log how difficult it felt (e.g., scale of 1-10).
II. Deeper Planning & Guidance:

Advanced Workout Plan Generator: Beyond basic muscle selection, filter by goals (strength, hypertrophy, endurance), available equipment, time per session, days per week.
Exercise Substitution: When viewing a plan or exercise, offer a button to suggest/select alternative exercises targeting the same muscle group but using different equipment or variations.
Progressive Overload Suggestions: Based on logged workout history for an exercise, suggest potential increases for the next session (e.g., "+2.5kg", "+1 rep").
Pre-Built Programs: Offer a library of complete workout programs (e.g., 4-week strength block, 12-week hypertrophy plan) created by admins that users can follow.
Warm-up/Cool-down Generator: Suggest simple routines based on the main exercises planned for the workout.
Meal Planning Interface: Allow users to drag/drop foods or meals onto a weekly calendar view to plan nutrition.
III. More Insightful Analysis & Reporting:

Personal Records (PRs): Automatically detect and display PRs (e.g., heaviest weight lifted for X reps, fastest time, longest duration) based on logged workouts.
Workout Volume Tracking: Calculate and chart volume (Sets * Reps * Weight) per workout, per muscle group, or over time.
Consistency Tracker: Use a calendar heatmap or streak counter to visualize workout frequency and adherence to plans.
Advanced Nutrition Reports: Breakdown of average macro/micronutrient intake over selected periods (requires detailed food data).
Weight Trend Analysis: Show rate of change, projected trends, or comparison to goals.
IV. Community & Social Features:

Activity Feed: A feed showing recent public activities of friends (workouts logged, PRs achieved, blog posts created).
Workout/Plan Sharing: Allow users to share their custom workout plans or logged sessions with friends within the app.
Challenges: Admin-created or user-created fitness challenges (e.g., "Log 3 workouts this week", "30-day plank challenge") with participation tracking.
Comments & Likes: Allow users to comment on or like logged workouts, blog posts, or shared plans.
V. Content & Education:

Recipe Database: A section for users/admins to share healthy recipes with ingredients, instructions, and estimated nutritional info.
Exercise Library Filters: Add more filtering options (equipment needed, force type - push/pull, specific smaller muscles).
Form Check Integration (Conceptual): Placeholder for future AI form analysis or ability to link videos for feedback.
VI. Utility & Personalization:

Goal Setting: Dedicated section to set specific, measurable goals (e.g., "Lose 5kg by July", "Bench Press 100kg", "Run 5k") and track progress.
Customizable Dashboard: Allow users to add, remove, or rearrange the widgets shown on their dashboard.
Calculators: Integrate fitness calculators (BMR/TDEE, 1 Rep Max estimate, Macro calculator).
Data Export: Allow users to export their logged data (workouts, weight, meals) as CSV.
